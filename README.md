# Affordable-Housing-Risk-Assessment-and-Demand-Prediction
This project utilizes a Physics-Informed Neural Network (PINN) to evaluate and predict the demand satisfaction of various affordable housing options. By integrating a rating agency's perspective, the model assesses financial and operational risks, assigns rating grades, and forecasts daily contributions to meet housing demand, facilitating informed investment and policy decisions.

📊 Features
Synthetic Data Generation: Simulates a diverse dataset of affordable housing options with relevant financial, environmental, and social indicators.
Risk Assessment and Grading: Evaluates each housing option based on default risk, regulatory compliance, and liquidity risk, assigning rating grades from 'AAA' to 'CCC'.
Model Development: Constructs separate regression and classification neural network models, incorporating constraints to ensure reliable predictions.
Comprehensive Evaluation: Measures model performance using metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), R² score, accuracy, and provides detailed classification reports.
Visualization: Generates plots for training progress, actual vs. predicted demand satisfaction, residual distributions, and confusion matrices to facilitate result interpretation.
Individual Contribution Analysis: Calculates and displays the daily contributions of each affordable housing option towards meeting the overall housing demand.
